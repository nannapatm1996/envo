A body of water does not have to be still or contained; Rivers, streams, canals, and other geographical features where water moves from one place to another are also considered bodies of water.

comment: The definitions of forest can vary greatly, and different classes will be needed to support the major categories. Tree cover alone is not enough to distinguish between forests and plantations. The international definition proposed by the 2010 FAO Forestry Resource Assessment: "land spanning more than 0.5 ha with trees higher than 5 metres and canopy cover of more than 10 percent, or trees able to reach these thresholds in situ . It does not include land that is predominantly under agricultural or urban land use." - FAO.  2010. Global forest resources assessment 2010, Main report, FAO Forestry Paper 163. Rome.

The exact definition of a mineral is under debate, especially with respect to the requirement a valid species be abiogenic, and to a lesser extent with regards to it having an ordered atomic structure.

def: "Soil is an environmental material which is primarily composed of minerals, varying proportions of sand, silt, and clay, organic material such as humus, gases, liquids, and a broad range of resident micro- and macroorganisms." [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil]
comment: 'In engineering terms, soil is referred to as regolith, or loose rock material that lies above the 'solid geology'. Soil is commonly referred to as "earth" or "dirt"; technically, the term "dirt" should be restricted to displaced soil.' https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil\n\n" The upper limit of soil is the boundary between soil and air, shallow water, live plants, or plant materials that have not begun to decompose. Areas are not considered to have soil if the surface is permanently covered by water too deep (typically more than 2.5 meters) for the growth of rooted plants.\n\nThe lower boundary that separates soil from the nonsoil underneath is most difficult to define. Soil consists of horizons near the Earth's surface that, in contrast to the underlying parent material, have been altered by the interactions of climate, relief, and living organisms over time. Commonly, soil grades at its lower boundary to hard rock or to earthy materials virtually devoid of animals, roots, or other marks of biological activity. For purposes of classification, the lower boundary of soil is arbitrarily set at 200 cm."

comment: Everything under this parent must be a mass noun. All subclasses are to be understood as being composed primarily of the named entity, rather than restricted to that entity. For example, "ENVO:water" is to be understood as "environmental material composed primarly of some CHEBI:water". This class is currently being aligned to the Basic Formal Ontology. Following this alignment, its definition and the definitions of its subclasses will be revised.

comment: This class is distinct from a geometric surface, which is two-dimensional. The idea of "uppermost" may be problematic. Further, the definition of layer (the superclass of surface in rev 133) references surface. This may be another issue. Perhaps this can be made into an inferred class using 'bounding layer of' some material entity, note that 'bounding layer' implies containment, which may not be valid here.

def: "Silt is granular material of a size somewhere between sand and clay whose mineral origin is quartz and feldspar." [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silt]
comment: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ In the Udden-Wentworth scale (due to Krumbein), silt particles range between 0.0039 to 0.0625 mm, larger than clay but smaller than sand particles. ISO 14688 grades silts between 0.002 mm and 0.063 mm. In actuality, silt is chemically distinct from clay, and unlike clay, grains of silt are approximately the same size in all dimensions; furthermore, their size ranges overlap. Clays are formed from thin plate-shaped particles held together by electrostatic forces, so present a cohesion. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture Soil Texture Classification system, the sand-silt distinction is made at the 0.05 mm particle size. The USDA system has been adopted by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). In the Unified Soil Classification System (USCS) and the AASHTO Soil Classification system, the sand-silt distinction is made at the 0.075 mm particle size (i.e., material passing the #200 sieve). Silts and clays are distinguished mechanically by their plasticity.

comment: Ocean biomes are determined by major bodies of saline water, principal components of the hydrosphere. Approximately 71% of the Earth's surface is covered by ocean, a continuous body of water that is customarily divided into several principal oceans and smaller seas. More than half of this area is over 3,000 metres (9,800 ft) deep. Average oceanic salinity is around 35 parts per thousand (ppt) (3.5%), and nearly all seawater has a salinity in the range of 30 to 38 ppt.

def: "Ice which is formed from water." [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice]
comment: Water ice can appear transparent or opaque bluish-white color, depending on the presence of impurities or air inclusions. The addition of other materials such as soil may further alter its appearance.\n\nWhen speaking about ice on Earth, usually water ice is meant - the solid, crystalline form of water found in the atmosphere as snow crystals, hail, ice pellets, etc., and on the earth's surface in forms such as hoarfrost, rime, glaze, sea ice, glacier ice, ground ice, frazil, anchor ice, etc.\n\nThis form of water is, strictly speaking, called ice Ih, the Roman numeral I distinguishing it from more than a dozen other phases and the letter h distinguishing it from the metastable cubic phase ice Ic. Ice Ih is the only one of the several known phases of water ice that is stable at commonly occurring temperatures and pressures. (Some of the other forms have very unusual properties, ice VII, for example, being stable only at pressures above 22 400 kg/cm^2, but then existing at temperatures up to about 100C.)\n\nIt has an open structure with a specific gravity of 0.9166 which is slightly less than water; because the water molecules bond to their neighbors covalently only in four directions; it therefore floats on higher density water, where broken molecular bonds permit closer packing. All commonly occurring forms of ice are crystalline, although large single crystals are relatively rare except in glaciers. The ice crystal lattice possesses hexagonal symmetry that manifests itself in the gross forms of such single crystals as are sometimes found in snow. At an air pressure of one atmosphere, ice melts at 0 C by definition of the Celsius temperature scale. (Strictly speaking the equilibrium point among water, ice, and vapor occurs at +0.01C, the triple point.) On the other hand, ice does not invariably form in liquid water cooled below this temperature; it has a tendency to supercool, more so in the absence of ice nuclei.\n\nIn permafrost regions, ice may occupy voids in soils and rocks and may develop in a variety of forms. Ice may be colourless to pale blue or greenish-blue. It may appear white due to included gas bubbles; in exposures, ground ice may also appear black.\n\nIn nature ice is formed either by: (a) the freezing of water, (b) the condensation of atmospheric water vapour direct into ice crystals, (c) the compaction of snow with or without the motion of a glacier, or (d) the impregnation of porous snow masses with water which subsequently freeze.

comment: ENVO contains this top-level class, but all instances will be in GAZ. The definition is preliminary and will be aligned to BFO.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/  Ecozones correspond to the floristic kingdoms of botany or zoogeographic regions of zoology. Ecozones are characterized by the evolutionary history of the organisms they contain. They are distinct from biomes, also known as major habitat types, which are divisions of the Earth's surface based on life form, or the adaptation of plants and animals to climatic, soil, and other conditions. Biomes are characterized by similar climax vegetation. Each ecozone may include a number of different biomes. A tropical moist broadleaf forest in Central America, for example, may be similar to one in New Guinea in its vegetation type and structure, climate, soils, etc., but these forests are inhabited by plants and animals with very different evolutionary histories.

def: "A planet which has a surface layer that nearly completely or completely covered by ice, and which has a substantial portion of its mass composed of ice." [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_planet]
comment: While this planetary form is still mostly theoretical, strong candidates exist such as OGLE-2005-BLG-390Lb, OGLE-2013-BLG-0341L b and MOA-2007-BLG-192Lb. Pluto was considered an ice planet until its reclassification in 2006 CE.  Surface temperatures of ice planets would have to be below 260 K (−13°C) if composed primarily of water, below 180 K (−93°C) if primarily composed of CO2 and ammonia, and below 80 K (−193°C) if composed primarily of methane. {xref="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_planet"}

comment: This class of planets is still mostly theoretical, however, lava planets are thought plausible shortly after a terrestrial planet is formed, soon after a terrestrial planet has suffered a large collision event, or if a terrestrial planet is orbiting very close to its star, causing intense irradiation and tidal forces.  Likely lava exoplanets include COROT-7b, Kepler-10b, Alpha Centauri Bb, and Kepler-78b. {xref="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lava_planet"}

comment: Materials which are usually assessed when appraising geodiversity include minerals, rocks, sediments, fossils, soils and water. Landforms factored into geodiversity metrics typically include folds, faults, and other expressions of morphology or relations between units of earth material. Natural processes that are included in measures of geodiversity are those which either maintain or change materials or geoforms, including tectonics, sediment transport, and pedogenesis.

comment: The definitions of forest can vary greatly, and different classes will be needed to support the major categories.

It does not include land that is predominantly under agricultural or urban land use." - FAO.  2010. Global forest resources assessment 2010, Main report, FAO Forestry Paper 163. Rome.

def: "A material accumulation process during which the mass of snow on a surface increases." [http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4808-4736]
comment: This term is used both as a process and as an amount of mass added. Semantically speaking these are two distinct concepts (e.g., accumulation results in accumulation_amount of ice or snow gain), though accumulation_amount would more likely be an attribute.\n\nThe scope of this term varies depending on the definition.  Some definitions constrain themselves snow or ice added to glaciers; while others also include ice fields, snow cover, and/or floating ice.  How to resolve this depends on the scope desired.\n\nSome definitions include additional discussion of the the physics involved which would be useful for connecting glacier ontologies to atmospheric, hydrologic, etc. ontologies.  This information should be captured no matter how the inconsistencies above are resolved.

comment: Landforms may be natural or anthropogenic. This term has often has loose usage when referencing entities which are either subterranean or submerged below water bodies. In some cases, oceans themselves are considered landforms. Here, we have provided subclasses to resolve this ambiguity, but place oceans and other water bodies elsewhere.In later revisions, this hiearchy is likely to be reordered based on the formation processes of the entities within it.

comment: The term refers collectively to the portions of the earth (i.e., a planet) where water is in solid form, including snow cover, floating ice, glaciers, ice caps, ice sheets, seasonally frozen ground and perennially frozen ground (permafrost). The Cryosphere may be divided into the cryoatmosphere, the cryohydrosphere (snow cover, glaciers, and river, lake and sea Ice) and the cryolithosphere (perennially and seasonally cryotic ground, rock glacier).\n\nThis is an Earth centric definition, other cryospheres will be considered later. Some definitions reffer to that which is sufficiently cold for pure water to freeze for at least a part of each year.\n\nIt should be noted that "Some authorities exclude the earth's atmosphere from the Earth's Cryosphere; others restrict the term Cryosphere to the regions of the earth's crust where Permafrost exists."\n\nDefinitions of Cryosphere come from several glossaries including:\n- PhysicalGeography.net http://physicalgeography.net/\n-  van Everdingen, Robert, ed., 2005 (1998 revised May 2005).

comment: Prior to curing, thermoset materials often occur as a soft solid or viscous liquid prepolymer or resin. In the literature, those are often referred to thermosetting resins.\nDuring curing process, well-defined and irreversible chemical networks form in three dimensions thus giving the thermosets a strong and rigid structure that can be added to other materials to increase strength. {xref="https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-816808-0.00001-9"}

It may be used to describe every organisms living in an area, but is often used to refer only to organisms of a particular taxon or guild (e.g., the plant community, the insect community, the herbivore community). The word community, as it often used to describe a group of humans living together, is a type of single-species collection of organisms, not an ecological community.

The assertion P preceded_by P1 tells us something about Ps in general: that is, it tells us something about what happened earlier, given what we know about what happened later. Thus it does not provide information pointing in the opposite direction, concerning instances of P1 in general; that is, that each is such as to be succeeded by some instance of P. Note that an assertion to the effect that P preceded_by P1 is rather weak; it tells us little about the relations between the underlying instances in virtue of which the preceded_by relation obtains. Typically we will be interested in stronger relations, for example in the relation immediately_preceded_by, or in relations which combine preceded_by with a condition to the effect that the corresponding instances of P and P1 share participants, or that their participants are connected by relations of derivation, or (as a first step along the road to a treatment of causality) that the one process in some way affects (for example, initiates or regulates) the other." xsd:string

property_value: IAO:0000116 "This branch of the ontology deals with causal relations between entities. It is divided into two branches: causal relations between occurrents/processes, and causal relations between material entities. We take an 'activity flow-centric approach', with the former as primary, and define causal relations between material entities in terms of causal relations between occurrents.\n\nTo define causal relations in an activity-flow type network, we make use of 3 primitives:\n\n * Temporal: how do the intervals of the two occurrents relate? \n * Is the causal relation regulatory?\n * Is the influence positive or negative\n\nThe first of these can be formalized in terms of the Allen Interval Algebra. Informally, the 3 bins we care about are 'direct', 'indirect' or overlapping. Note that all causal relations should be classified under a RO temporal relation (see the branch under 'temporally related to'). Note that all causal relations are temporal, but not all temporal relations are causal. Two occurrents can be related in time without being causally connected. We take causal influence to be primitive, elucidated as being such that has the upstream changed, some qualities of the donwstream would necessarily be modified.\n\nFor the second, we consider a relationship to be regulatory if the system in which the activities occur is capable of altering the relationship to achieve some objective. This could include changing the rate of production of a molecule.\n\nFor the third, we consider the effect of the upstream process on the output(s) of the downstream process. If the level of output is increased, or the rate of production of the output is increased, then the direction is increased. Direction can be positive, negative or neutral or capable of either direction. Two positives in succession yield a positive, two negatives in succession yield a positive, otherwise the default assumption is that the net effect is canceled and the influence is neutral.\n\nEach of these 3 primitives can be composed to yield a cross-product of different relation types." xsd:string
